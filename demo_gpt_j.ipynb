I myself am also a native Catalan speaker and I’m part of a new wave of young people coming across from other parts of Spain who are very young, and who are very enthusiastic to defend our language and our culture. It’s the language of our culture. It’s a language that should be respected as part of our heritage, as a part of our culture. And we also say that we are a very bilingual country – not to be confused with a multicultural country. We speak, and we want to preserve, our language.\n",
